# NBA2020-2021
# This is my Machine Learning project which aims to predict results of NBA 2020-21 regular season games.
# Predictions of only first half is being uploaded for now as schedule has been released only upto that point as of statrt of NBA 2020-21 regular season i.e 22nd december.
# A player based rating system (ESPN's real plus minus) has been used to train model.
# Top 10 players (starting line up and 1st bench) are considered while training the model.
# Considering the player was healthy, most recent performance i.e NBA 2019-2020 has beens considered. If coming off from an injury( for eg steph curry,kevin durant, john wall...), their previous year performances have been considered.
# The most crucial part of rating players, was rating rookies as their espn rpm is not available. For that, based on draft order and intution, rookies have been rated.
# The predicitions heavily rely on players being healthy. Already before the start of season, few injuries( kemba walker out till january...) have ocurred.
# Due to the ongoing pandemic, NBA may be forced to postpone, delay, alter the schedule of NBA 2020-21 regular season.
